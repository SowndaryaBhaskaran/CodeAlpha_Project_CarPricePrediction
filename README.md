# CodeAlpha_Project_CarPricePrediction
**Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning**


**Overview**

This project aims to predict the selling price of cars using various machine learning models. It leverages a dataset containing features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, and mileage, among others. The project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation.

**Data Description**

The dataset consists of the following columns:

**Car_Name:** Name of the car

**Year:** Year of manufacture

**Selling_Price:** Price at which the car is sold (target variable)

**Present_Price:** Current market price of the car

**Driven_kms:** Total kilometers driven

**Fuel_Type:** Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel)

**Selling_type:** Type of sale (e.g., Dealer, Individual)

**Transmission:** Type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic)

**Owner:** Number of previous owners

**Models Used**

This project implements the following machine learning models:

**Random Forest Regressor:**

A robust ensemble model that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
**Linear Regression:** 

A simple yet effective model for predicting continuous outcomes.

**Evaluation Metrics**

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

**Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 

Measures the average of the squares of the errors.

**R-squared (R²):**

Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.

**Results**

The models achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

**Random Forest:**

MSE:0.7710541483606554

R²:0.9665276933745053 

**Linear Regression:**

MSE:2.2878270623726618 

R²:0.9006829168863724
